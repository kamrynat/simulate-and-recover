This project implements a simulate-and-recover experiment to test the consistency of the EZ diffusion model. The goal is to determine if parameters estimated using the model match those that generated the data. The experiment is repeated 1000 times for different sample sizes (N = 10, 40, 4000). 

The experiment begins by randomly selecting model parameters within predefined ranges: boundary separation (a) between 0.5 and 2.0, drift rate (v) between 0.5 and 2.0, and non-decision time (t) between 0.1 and 0.5. Using the forward EZ diffusion equations, we generate response time (RT) and accuracy data, introducing variability by drawing samples from distributions derived from the theoretical model. The next step involves recovering parameters from the simulated data using the inverse EZ diffusion equations. To ensure numerical stability, adjustments are applied to prevent calculation errors, particularly when working with extreme values. The accuracy of the recovered parameters is assessed by computing the bias, which represents the difference between the recovered and true values, and the squared error, which evaluates how estimation error changes as the sample size increases. Finally, the results are compared across N = 10, 40, and 4000 to analyze how sample size impacts recovery accuracy.

The results indicate that, on average, the recovered parameters deviate slightly from their true values, but the bias remains relatively small. As the sample size increases, the squared error decreases significantly, demonstrating that larger datasets lead to more accurate parameter estimates. When N is small (e.g., N=10), the parameter recovery process exhibits greater variance, suggesting that estimates derived from limited data points are inherently less stable. However, as N increases, the recovered parameters become increasingly accurate, affirming that the EZ diffusion model is self-consistent when estimating its own parameters. Despite these improvements, some numerical instabilities were observed in extreme cases, requiring further refinements to the recovery formulas.

These findings align with theoretical expectations. When sample sizes are small, higher variance in recovered parameters causes deviations from their true values, making parameter estimation less reliable. In contrast, larger sample sizes provide more stable estimates and lower error rates. The EZ diffusion model, while effective, remains an approximation, and its performance varies depending on data quality and sample size. The variability observed at lower sample sizes suggests that researchers should aim to use larger datasets whenever possible to enhance the reliability of parameter recovery. Additionally, extreme values in parameter estimates were occasionally observed due to instability in variance calculations, underscoring the importance of applying appropriate numerical adjustments. Practically, this study confirms that the EZ diffusion model is useful for cognitive modeling but should be employed with caution, particularly for small datasets. Researchers should be mindful of bias and variance when applying the model to empirical data and should take measures such as eliminating outliers and ensuring sufficient trials to improve estimation accuracy.

This experiment demonstrates that the EZ diffusion model is self-consistent and capable of accurately recovering its own parameters, provided a sufficiently large sample size is used. The decreasing squared error trend suggests that parameter estimation improves with more data, reinforcing the model’s reliability in cognitive modeling applications. However, researchers should be cautious when working with small datasets, as estimation variance can be substantial. Overall, this study validates the EZ diffusion model’s effectiveness in parameter recovery and highlights best practices for using it in research.
